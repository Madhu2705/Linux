1)ps: means process status 
2)ps -e:everything it shows all the process  
3)ps -f:full form 
ps -aux 

all user extra , Shows a detailed listing of all processes running on the system, including those started by other  

users, and additional information about each process. 

ps -t terminal to show all the processes related to a specific terminal  

 


ps -G groupId   ----> to show all process related to groupId 

ps -C commandname   -----> to show all process related to a perticular command 

ps -l  ----> longform shows additional info about each process 

 

F         ------> The process's flags or state. 

UID      -----> The user ID of the process owner. 

PID       -----> The process ID of the process. 

PPID      ---->The parent process ID of the process. 

C:           ---->The CPU utilization of the process. 

PRI:       ---->The priority of the process. 

NI:       ----->The nice value of the process. 

ADDR:   ---> The memory address of the process. 

SZ:          ---> The size of the process in memory (in kilobytes). 

WCHAN: --> The name of the kernel function that the process is waiting on. 

TTY:        ---> The terminal that the process is running on. 

TIME:   ----->The CPU time used by the process. 

CMD:    ----->The command that started the process. 

ps -r   ----> view all the running processes
kill :- 

kill pid   ----> kill process kill -9 pid   ----> focefully terminate  

kill -STOP  pid  ----->  to stop/pause a process kill -CONT pid  -----> to start/resume a process  

 killall :- 

using killall command we can kill a process by name 

-r  ----> we can use regular expression 

-v ----> verbose 

-i  ----> intrective  

-I  ----> ignore case  ( capital i)  



Top :- 

 

 

------->   Uptime    , user count , load average ,  

------->  cpu count ( press 1 to check other cpus ), user process, system                         process, nice value, idle, 

                        hardware intrupt, system interrupt, stolen time     3    ------->   free 

Res ----> reserved memory Virt -----> virtual memory 

Shr  -----> shared memory 

S ----> running , stopped , idle etc 

Press u ----> enter username 

K   ----> kill  

‘M’ to sort by memory usage 

‘P’ to sort by CPU usage 

‘N’ to sort by process ID 

‘T’ to sort by the running time 

By default, top displays all results in descending order. However, you can switch to ascending order by pressing ‘R’
